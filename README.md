## üöÄ Project Overview

**CropNurture** is an AI-powered web and mobile application designed to predict and manage crop diseases. Our goal is to help farmers by providing real-time disease prevention and treatment recommendations through advanced image analysis, weather forecasting, and geolocation.

### üåø Key Features:

- **AI-Powered Disease Detection:** Utilizes deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), trained on over 10,000 images with an accuracy of 97.2%.
- **Real-Time Recommendations:** Provides instant disease diagnosis and treatment suggestions by analyzing crop images.
- **Outbreak Alerts:** Notifies farmers about local disease trends, helping them take early preventive actions.
- **Pharmacist Locator:** Uses geolocation to help farmers find nearby crop care providers quickly.
- **Weather and Soil-based Predictions:** Incorporates weather forecasting and soil analysis to predict potential disease outbreaks.
- **Multi-language Support:** Ensures accessibility in various local languages for easy use by farmers across different regions.
- **Offline Functionality:** Allows farmers to upload images and receive diagnoses even in areas with limited internet connectivity.
- **Virtual Consultation:** Offers real-time video consultations with agricultural experts.
- **Community Platform:** Provides a space for farmers to share experiences, seek advice, and stay connected.
